        <strong>Definition: </strong>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Betweenness_centrality">Betweenness centrality</a> is a
        measure of a node's centrality in a network. It is equal to the number of shortest paths from all vertices to
        all others that pass through that node. Betweenness centrality is a more useful measure (than just connectivity)
        of both the load and importance of a node.

        Note: This does not scale with large graphs as the complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2 + nm).
