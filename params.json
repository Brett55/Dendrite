Places. Things. Graphs.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that much of the world, both physical and virtual, can be represented as a graph. Graphs describe things that are linked together such as web pages and human societies. Like many other topics, Web technologies can make these types of powerful mathematical concepts more accessible to everyday users.\r\nDendrite is a Lab41 exploration of ways to analyze, manipulate, version, and share extremely large graphs:\r\n- The Web frontend leverages AngularJS to provide a responsive data-driven experience\r\n- The UI interacts with a backend instance of the Titan Distributed Graph Database\r\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n====================\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Lab4/Dendrite.git\r\ncd Dendrite\r\nmvn tomcat:run\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequired Dependencies\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Java\r\n- Maven\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n1. After the webserver is up and running browse to http://server.fqdn:8080/dendrite\r\n\r\n2. Login as a user with user/password or as an admin with admin/password\r\n\r\nCurrently supported graph formats \r\n================================\r\n\r\n- GML\r\n- GraphML\r\n- GraphSON\r\n\r\nRelated repositories\r\n====================\r\n\r\n - [graph-generators](http://lab41.github.io/graph-generators/)\r\n - [MRKronecker](https://github.com/Lab41/MRKronecker)\r\n\r\nContributing to Dendrite\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nWhat to contribute?
